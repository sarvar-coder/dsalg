Valid palindrome 2

if reversed word is equal the true word then return true.
But there is some requirement.
If we remove at most one character, still is equal, then we return true.

Check to neglect the both sides of character. Character at left and right index if it does not overflow lowerbound and upperbound respectively.

My mistake is that trying to cover all cases.
It should be simpler.
