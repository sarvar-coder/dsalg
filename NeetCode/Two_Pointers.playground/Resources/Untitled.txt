Valid palindrome 2

if reversed word is equal the true word then return true.
But there is some requirement.
If we remove at most one character, still is equal, then we return true.

Check to neglect the both sides of character. Character at left and right index if it does not overflow lowerbound and upperbound respectively.

My mistake is that trying to cover all cases.
It should be simpler.


MergeAlternately:

You are given two strings word1 and word2.
Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1.
If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

2 ta soz beriladi va shulardan yang soz yaratish kerak. Yangi soz 1 - sozdan 1 ta harf olinib keyin 2- dan
ham bitta harf olinib qoshiladi va shu tartibda davom etadi. Biri ikkinchisidan harfi kop bolsa yangi
sozni orqasiga qolgan harflarni qoshib qoyamiz.
